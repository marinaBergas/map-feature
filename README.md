 Create a web project using React JavaScript library
 Build the page in the provided design file trying to match the design as much as possible.
Make the page fully responsive as you resize the page, again matching the designs as closely as
possible. The Design document shows the page in desktop (page 1), tablet (page 2), and mobile (page
 resolutions but the page should flow well in any resolution.
 Make an API call to the provided schools API from Scholarhood
(http://www.scholarhood.ca/devtest.json) and get an array of school data in JSON format.
 Use that data to generate the “Featured schools” cards.
 The cards should ideally be a reusable component.
 The cards should contain information about the school in the lower section and a map with a pin placed
using the provided latitude and longitude data for the school
 School boundary data is also included. Use it to draw the boundaries on the map.
 Create a carousel containing all the school cards. Try not to use a library for the carousel.
 Clicking on any of the school cards should open a new page just displaying an H1 with the name of the
school and the url should be the dasherized school name. 
 Write automated tests and provide as thorough code coverage as possible
